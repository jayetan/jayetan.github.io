In case already have a personal Github account and want to create a new one for your projects or your client on a single machine (computer) follow this easy steps.

First - Create a new ssh key by typing in the terminal
<code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "email address"</code>
a prompt will show asking where to save the generated key be carefull not to overwrite your existing key just save it as ex. <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa_clientName</code>
