Adding this page content was not really easy for me probably because I really don't read the documentation, I was relying on experimentationand testing, I thought pushing new contents was same as in github using
<code>git add. git commit and git push</code> Octopress is different you have to use <code>rake generate and rake deploy</code> to update your contents.
Sometime this week I'll be adding more pages for my blogs about what I have learned from this wonderfull company from the day I start training, I couldn't really remember when is the day I started but its before Feb. 26 so I could say that I've training for one month now and so far it really helps me to learn the things I need to learn.
