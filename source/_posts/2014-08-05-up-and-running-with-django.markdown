After we learned how to program using <a href="http://jayetan.github.io/blog/2014/06/30/learning-python/">python</a> its now time to apply it on Django.


What is Django?

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(web_framework)">Django</a> is a free and open source web application framework, written in Python, which follows the model–view–controller architectural pattern.
Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. Django emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself. Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.


How to install

first download the tarball of django at https://www.djangoproject.com/download/
extract it and via terminal go to the extracted folder of django, then type
<pre>
	sudo python setup.py install
</pre> 
if it didn't work you can read the README.rst which can be found at the extracted django folder and read the instruction on how to install it.
