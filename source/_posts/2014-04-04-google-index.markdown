After making some blogs, I searched for Boinx and Bryan's blogs to see if Google already indexed their site by typing in the browser <code>site:http://urlOfTheSite</code> since I'm thinking their site is already running since Dec. 2013 it should be indexed by now, but Google bots doesn't able to pick thier site. so I linked their sites to my Octopress site and submitted my site to Google Index via Google Webmaster tools <code><a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/">https://www.google.com/webmasters/</a></code> afterward I have to download the html verification file and uploaded it to my site server and click the verify button. after an hour I checked again my site and my friend's site and now its already indexed by Google, hoping it will gain some rankings after some time for a chance to be read by other viewers.
